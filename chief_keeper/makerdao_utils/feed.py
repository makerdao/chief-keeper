    """A client for the `DSValue` contract, a single-value data feed.

    `DSValue` is a single-value data feed, which means it can be in one of two states.
    It can either contain a value (in which case `has_value()` returns `True` and the read methods
    return that value) or be empty (in which case `has_value()` returns `False` and the read
    methods throw exceptions).

    `DSValue` can be populated with a new value using `poke()` and cleared using `void()`.

    Everybody can read from a `DSValue`.
    Calling `poke()` and `void()` is usually whitelisted to some addresses only.

    The `DSValue` contract keeps the value as a 32-byte array (Ethereum `bytes32` type).
    Methods have been provided to cast it into `int`, read as hex etc.

    You can find the source code of the `DSValue` contract here:
    <https://github.com/dapphub/ds-value>.

    Attributes:
        web3: An instance of `Web` from `web3.py`.
