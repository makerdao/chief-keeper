    """A client for the `TxManager` contract.

    `TxManager` allows to invoke multiple contract methods in one Ethereum transaction.
    Each invocation is represented as an instance of the `Invocation` class, containing a
    contract address and a calldata.

    In addition to that, these invocations can use ERC20 token balances. In order to do that,
    the entire allowance of each token involved is transferred from the caller to the `TxManager`
    contract at the beginning of the transaction and all the remaining balances are returned
    to the caller at the end of it. In order to use this feature, ERC20 token allowances
    have to be granted to the `TxManager`.

    You can find the source code of the `TxManager` contract here:
    <https://github.com/makerdao/tx-manager>.

        web3: An instance of `Web` from `web3.py`.
